VSeeFace is a highly configurable face and hand tracking VRM avatar puppeteering program for virtual youtubers with a focus on robust tracking and high image quality.

Face tracking, including gaze and mouth tracking, is done through a regular webcam. For hand tracking, a Leap Motion device is required.
You can see a comparison of the face tracking performance compared to other popular vtuber applications [here](https://twitter.com/emiliana_vt/status/1275424412167221248).
In this comparison, VSeeFace is still listed under its former name of OpenSeeFaceDemo.

It is currently in open beta and can be found for download in the latest pinned message of the `#tech-dev` channel
