## About

VSeeFace is a highly configurable face and hand tracking VRM avatar puppeteering program for virtual youtubers with a focus on robust tracking and high image quality.

Face tracking, including gaze and mouth tracking, is done through a regular webcam. For hand tracking, a Leap Motion device is required. You can see a comparison of the face tracking performance compared to other popular vtuber applications [here](https://twitter.com/emiliana_vt/status/1275424412167221248). In this comparison, VSeeFace is still listed under its former name OpenSeeFaceDemo.

## Download

**The only legitimate and correct way to download VSeeFace is as described below. OpenSeeFace is not VSeeFace. VSeeFace does not cost money.**

VSeeFace is currently in open beta and can be found for download in the latest pinned message of the `#tech-dev` channel of @[Virtual_Deat](https://twitter.com/Virtual_Deat)'s [discord server](https://discord.gg/BjBgk7k). The latest release notes can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/emilianavt/90bc0b73e2713276e6f630db09977eae). I post news about new versions and the development process in Twitter with the `#VSeeFace` hashtag.

The reason it is currently only released in this way, is to make sure that everybody who tries it out has an easy channel to give me feedback.

## Terms of use

You can use VSeeFace to stream or do pretty much anything you like. Please just do not give anybody a copy directly or pass the download link around. It's still very much in development, so I want every user to be able to find updates and give feedback easily. If somebody is interested, you can just point them to this page.
