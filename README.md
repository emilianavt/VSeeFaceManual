## About

VSeeFace is a highly configurable face and hand tracking VRM avatar puppeteering program for virtual youtubers with a focus on robust tracking and high image quality.

Face tracking, including gaze and mouth tracking, is done through a regular webcam. For hand tracking, a Leap Motion device is required. You can see a comparison of the face tracking performance compared to other popular vtuber applications [here](https://twitter.com/emiliana_vt/status/1275424412167221248). In this comparison, VSeeFace is still listed under its former name OpenSeeFaceDemo.

## Download

VSeeFace is currently in open beta and can be found for download in the latest pinned message of the `#tech-dev` channel of @[Virtual_Deat](https://twitter.com/Virtual_Deat)'s discord server. The latest release notes can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/emilianavt/90bc0b73e2713276e6f630db09977eae). I post news about new versions and the development process in Twitter with the `#VSeeFace` hashtag.

The reason it is currently only released in this way, is to make sure that everybody who tries it out has an easy channel to give me feedback.
